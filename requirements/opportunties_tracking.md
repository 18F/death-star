## opportunities tracking

the things that the project intake team(s) need to receive, triage, and present for decision opportunities for the various 18f business lines.

## requirements

- List of leads and status in intake process (need to know what kind of "statuses" exist)
- either closely integrate with google docs for note taking or have a platform for lead-related notes
    - Easy to update (ideally takes three clicks)
- ability to pull up past requests or past/current agreements by category/search
- Reporting on lead statistics (number/month, time from intro-to-IAA)
- ability to tag request types (use case: identify all "open data" interactions)
- Flagging projects that need action by 18F
    - prompts that indicate when a lead has gotten "stale" etc...
    - built on a set up business rules
    - who has next step and when is it due? specifically, does 18f need to do anything?
- branching of projects (use case: one call turns into seven projects; helps with coordination between projects)
- integrations: Integration with Slack/Gmail/something to allow tracking of e-mails sent on each lead
    - maybe drop a copy of all emails to clients in a box that can be linked to
- opt-in updates on status
