## opportunities tracking

the things that the project intake team(s) need to receive, triage, and present for decision opportunities for the various 18f business lines.

## requirements by priority

- List of leads in/exited from intake process with statuses, contact info, and other data points
- ability to pull up past requests or past/current agreements by category/search
- ability to quickly filter entire list by categories
    - Use case: on a call with agency XYZ, they ask who else at XYZ we've talked to
- either closely integrate with google docs for note taking (e.g.: clickable hyperlinks) or have a platform for lead-related notes
    - Easy to update (ideally takes three clicks)
- Reporting on lead statistics (number/month, time from intro-to-IAA)
- ability to tag request types (use case: identify all "open data" interactions)
- Rapid/responsive interface

###Optional Requirements

- Flagging projects that need action by 18F
    - prompts that indicate when a lead has gotten "stale" etc...
    - built on a set up business rules
    - allows flagging: who has next step and when is it due? specifically, does 18f need to do anything?
- branching of projects (use case: one call turns into seven projects; helps with coordination between projects)
- integrations: Integration with Slack/Gmail/something to allow tracking of e-mails sent on each lead
    - maybe drop a copy of all emails to clients in a box that can be linked to
- Can be used to generate an agenda document for the intake meeting with all leads touched in past week
- opt-in updates on status
