## opportunities tracking

the things that the project intake team(s) need to receive, triage, and present for decision opportunities for the various 18f business lines.

## requirements

- List of leads and statuses (need to know what kind of "statuses" exist)
- either closely integrate with google docs for note taking or have a platform for note taking
  - Easy to update (should only take three clicks)
- ability to pull up past requests or past/current agreements
- ability to tag request types (use case: identify all "open data" interactions)
- Reporting on lead statistics
- integrations: Integration with Slack/Gmail/something to allow tracking of e-mails sent on each lead
  - maybe drop a copy of all emails to clients in a box that can be linked to
- prompts that indicate when a lead has gotten "stale" etc...
  - built on a set up business rules
- opt-in updates on status
- branching of projects (use case: one call turns into seven projects; helps with coordination between projects)
- who has next step and when is it due? specifically, does 18f need to do anything?
